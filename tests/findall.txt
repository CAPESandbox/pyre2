findall tests
=============

    >>> import re2

This one is from http://docs.python.org/library/re.html?#finding-all-adverbs:

    >>> re2.findall(r"\w+ly", "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police.")
    ['carefully', 'quickly']

This one makes sure all groups are found:

    >>> re2.findall( "(\w+)=(\d+)", "foo=1,foo=2")
    [('foo', '1'), ('foo', '2')]
